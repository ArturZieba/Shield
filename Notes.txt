Grip:
1. Low-positioned grip (low enough to be able to straighten/rest arm on thigh) like kite shields, combined with a strap could make the shield easy to carry.
2. Three grips on the handle placed toward the top of the shield, two for ambidexterity, one in the middle to support it from the bottom.

Reload:
1. Must be able to reload while blocking.
2. Just hanging on sling to the side while reloading?
3. Pouches for the mags on the interior of the shield? (Would need to be secured somehow to not fall out)

Strap:
1. Strap to alleviate some of the weight, make it carriable without holding it in hands.

Size/shape:
1. Tower shield would give a fuller safe range of motion for wielder and the team behind. Additionally legs would be covered, which would allow for easier traversal in an open field. This would make it heavier and less manouverable.
2. Smaller and narrower shield and using it in a "boxer" stance would make for a lot smaller target to hit. Range of motions of people behind would be restricted and would need additional cover at around waist-down height.

Setting in place:
1. If is a tower shield, could have some spikes/feet to emplace it as a wall or to block a doorway.

Materials:
1. Woodwork almost out of the question, would require a workshop for a few days to set up.
2. Some metal sheet?
3. Some composite/plastic?
